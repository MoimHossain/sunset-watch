# [sunset-watch](https://github.com/MoimHossain/sunset-watch)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MoimHossain/sunset-watch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MoimHossain/sunset-watch)

## What

**Sunset-watch** is an extremely _lightweight_ JavaScript library that allows running **BDD** style tests over web applications.


## Why
**sunset-watch** allows you to run **BDD** specifications on your 
web application but unlike **Selenium**, it runs into the _same_ browser session 
as the web application itself. Which makes it super easy to configure 
and run tests with minimum dependencies (only _jQuery_ at this moment) with other tools.

The idea in a nutshell is like following:

+ Add the script reference of the library into the html file.
+ Write your BDD features in an easy to read format (_pseudo_ **Gherkin**).
+ Kick off the tests when the page is ready.
+ The report will be shown up on the page after the test run.
+ The report can be posted to another HTTP server.

## How

+ Install the **sunset-watch** npm package.

```javascript
    > npm install sunset-watch --save
```
+ Create a javascript file (i.e. browserTest.js) to boot your BDD tests.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery';
import {} from 'sunset-watch';

var Behaviors = BDD.Behaviors;

$(document).ready(function() {
    
	require('./features/product.feature');

	Behaviors.run((report) => {		
		console.log(report)
	});
});

```  
Include the test file in the _index.html_ (or any other page) that boots your web application up.

##### Write the feature
In the test file above we saw a product.feature reference, we will write that now in a **product.feature.js** file.

```javascript
import steps from './stepDefinitions/product.stepDefinitions';
import {} from 'sunset-watch';


var Feature = BDD.Feature;

Feature('Product', steps)	
	.Scenario('Search product')
		.Given('I clicked on product Tab')			
		.When('I enter the word - "addidas"')			
		.Then('I see products matched they query');
```
Now, we will write another file that will glue this **feature** with the 
actual application. This file is known as step definitions file.
The idea of the _step definition_ is pretty much the same as other 
popular BDD JS frameworks (i.e. **Cucumber**). This is where you locate **DOM** elements,
raise events on them and do the relevant **asserts**. 

```javascript
import {} from 'sunset-watch';

var StepDefinitions = BDD.StepDefinitions;
var Dom = BDD.DOM;

class ProductStepDefinitions extends StepDefinitions {

    clickProductTab(next) {
        Dom.by.id('productTab').to.be.present(function (tab) {
            tab ?  tab.click(next) : next(false);
        });
    }

    search(next) {        
        Dom.by.id('productSearch').to.be.present(function(searchBox) {
            searchBox.sendKeys('Canon EOS 5d mark III', next);
        });
    }

    checkResult(next) {        
        Dom.by.id(this.firstProductSpanId).to.be.present(function(span) {
            next(span != null);
        });        
    }
    
    getStepDefinitions() {
        return [ {
            title: 'Search product',
            steps: [{
                title: 'I clicked on product Tab',
                fn: this.clickProductTab
            }, {
                title: 'I enter the word - "addidas"',
                fn: this.search
            }, {
                title: 'I see products matched they query',
                fn: this.checkResult
            }]
        }];
    }
}

export default new ProductStepDefinitions();
```

Now load the application in the browser and see it will play all the steps.

## Conclusion:
This library is very lightweight and feature wise limited 
compared to other sophisticated tools like **Selenium**. 
But this is way-less overhead when you want to write 
BDD tests quickly and increase productivity at max in a Dev machine. 

Nevertheless, this is by no means indicate that itâ€™s an alternate to Selenium.

Enjoy!
